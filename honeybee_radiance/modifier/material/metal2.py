class Metal2(Material):
    """Radiance Metal2 Material.

    Metal2 is the same as plastic2, except that the highlights are modified by the
    material color.

    Args:
        identifier: Text string for a unique Material ID. Must not contain spaces
            or special characters. This will be used to identify the object across
            a model and in the exported Radiance files.
        modifier: Modifier. It can be primitive, mixture, texture or pattern.
            (Default: None).
        values: An array 3 arrays for primitive data. Each of the 3 sub-arrays
            refer to a line number in the radiance primitive definitions and the
            values in each array correspond to values occurring within each line.
        is_opaque: A boolean to indicate whether this primitive is opaque.
        dependencies: A list of primitives that this primitive depends on. This
            argument is only useful for defining advanced primitives that are
            defined based on other primitives. (Default: []).
