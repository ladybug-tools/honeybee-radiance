    """Generate electric lighting schedules from annual daylight results.

    Such controls will dim the lights according to whether the illuminance values
    at the sensor locations are at a target illuminance setpoint. The results can be
    used to account for daylight controls in energy simulations.

    This function will generate one schedule per sensor grid in the simulation. Each
    grid should have sensors at the locations in space where daylight dimming sensors
    are located. Grids with one, two, or more sensors can be used to model setups
    where fractions of each room are controlled by different sensors. If the sensor
    grids are distributed over the entire floor of the rooms, the resulting schedules
    will be idealized, where light dimming has been optimized to supply the minimum
    illuminance setpoint everywhere in the room.
    
    Args:
        results_folder: The path to the folder containing the annual daylight
            result files.
        base_schedule: A list of 8760 fractional values for the lighting schedule
            representing the usage of lights without any daylight controls. The
            values of this schedule will be multiplied by the hourly dimming
            fraction to yield the output lighting schedules. If None, a schedule
            from 9AM to 5PM on weekdays will be used. (Default: None).
        ill_setpoint: A number for the illuminance setpoint in lux beyond which
            electric lights are dimmed if there is sufficient daylight.
            Some common setpoints are listed below. (Default: 300 lux).

            * 50 lux - Corridors and hallways.
            * 150 lux - Computer work spaces (screens provide illumination).
            * 300 lux - Paper work spaces (reading from surfaces that need illumination).
            * 500 lux - Retail spaces or museums illuminating merchandise/artifacts.
            * 1000 lux - Operating rooms and workshops where light is needed for safety.

        min_power_in: A number between 0 and 1 for the the lowest power the lighting
            system can dim down to, expressed as a fraction of maximum
            input power. (Default: 0.3).
        min_light_out: A number between 0 and 1 the lowest lighting output the lighting
            system can dim down to, expressed as a fraction of maximum light
            output. Note that setting this to 1 means lights aren't dimmed at
            all until the illuminance setpoint is reached. This can be used to
            approximate manual light-switching behavior when used in conjunction
            with the off_at_min input below. (Default: 0.2).
        off_at_min: Boolean to note whether lights should switch off completely when
            they get to the minimum power input. (Default: False).
    
    Returns:
        A tuple with two values.

        -   schedules: A list of lists where each sub-list represents an electric
            lighting dimming schedule for a sensor grid.

        -   schedule_ids: A list of text strings for the recommended names of the
            electric lighting schedules.
